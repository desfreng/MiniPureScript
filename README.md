# Petit Purescript

This is my project for the [Compilation course](https://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/ens/compil/index.html) given by Jean-Christophe Filli√¢tre  at the ENS in 2023.

The tests are those proposed at this address: https://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/ens/compil/projet/tests/

Use `make` to build the `ppurse` compiler, and `make clean` to clean the directory of all compiled files.

The following tests are available:

- Tests on parsing using the command `make parsing_test`.
- Semantic analysis tests using the command `make typing_test`.
